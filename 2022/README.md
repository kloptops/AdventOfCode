# 2022 - Advent of Code

For some reason I decided to do 2022 entirely on my phone using [Pythonista 3](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) on my iPhone with no external \*dependencies. This was a stupid idea, but I did get to day 22, so there we go.

\* except for PIL which was only used to visualise the output.
